						<h5>Towards a scholarly digital edition</h5>
						<p>As abundantly claimed by many scholars and masters in the field of Digital Humanities, <span class="em">a digitised edition is not a digital edition</span><span class="apice">1</span>. <span class="bold">The WWWasteLand Digital Edition</span> adhere to this tenet, therefore, it cannot be concevied as the mere transposition of a poem's drafts from an analog support to a digital environment. Then, how can we define this project?</p>
						<p>Transcribing a text into a digital format is an <span class="bold">analytical activity</span> that <span class="em">leads to the selection of some of the features connected with the object or domain which are considered relevant by the researcher</span></span><span class="apice">2</span>. With respect to the present edition, the "object" coincides with the <span class="bold">T. S. Eliot</span>'s original manuscript of "The Waste Land", bearing extensive editing changes by <span class="bold">Ezra Pound</span> and some other annotations by <span class="bold">Vivienne Eliot</span>, while the "features which are relevant to the researcher" will be introduced in the following paragraphs. However, the selection process is the first fundamental step towards the production of a scholarly edition, given its inherent necessity of underliying a <span class="em bold">criterion</span><span class="apice">3</span>.</p>
		    				<h5>The manuscript: "a hoard of fragments"</h5>
		    				<p><span class="bold">Why do we need a scholarly digital edition of the "The Waste Land" manuscript and how are we supposed to benefit from it?</span></p>
	    					<p>The answer to those questions can be easily found in the history of the poem as well as in the manuscript's destiny. T. S. Eliot started working on his drafts of "The Waste Land" in 1921. In January 1922, he decided to submit the manuscript to his friend and collegue Ezra Pound, who strongly supported Eliot's effort with his <span class="em">maieutic skill</span><span class="apice">4</span>(xxii). At the end of the same year, once the poem had already published, the manuscript was donated to John Quinn as a sign of gratitude for the financial assistance he had provided to the poet. After Quinn's death, all the trace of the manuscript were lost and it was still kept private after its acquisition by the <span class="bold">New York Public Library</span>. It was only in October 1968 that the Library revealed that the Eliot's original drafts had been unearthed.</p>
		    				<p>The manuscript-typescript is currently located in the Berg Collection held by the New York Public Library. The document comprises a mix of 54 typed and handwritten pages - 47 of which are single leaves - on a variety of different papers. Moreover, whe whole set of leaves appears divided into two sections: the main text, and the miscellanouse poems which were considered for it.</p>
		    				<p>This brief description seems to somehow justify what Eliot said about the genesis of his masterpiece: according to the author, "The Waste Land" began as a <span class="em bold">hoard of fragments</span>. Reproducing this intricate work and its crucial stages is the major aim of the present SDE.</p>

    &lt;/teiHeader&gt;



&lt;text&gt;
At the same level as the &lt;teiHeader&gt;, users will find the &lt;text&gt; element, whose inner elements correspond to the actual content of the source typescript. The current SDE aims at providing the users with an easy-to-use product, thus, the original pagination of Eliot’s drafts has been kept unchanged. As first consequence, the content of the &lt;text&gt; element has been split into a &lt;front&gt; element and the &lt;body&gt; part.
&lt;front&gt; 
Let’s now focus on the former element (&lt;front&gt;), whose structure looks like this:
&lt;front&gt;
  &lt;titlePage&gt;
    &lt;pb/&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;facsimile&gt;
        &lt;graphic/&gt;
      &lt;/facsimile&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;quote&gt;
	&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/titlePage&gt;
&lt;/front&gt;
The front of the typescript consists of a single title page, marked by the corresponding tag (&lt;titlePage&gt;). From now on, each page beginning is highlighted by the &lt;pb/&gt; tag, while the actual content of a page is placed inside the &lt;div&gt; element. This last tag always contains a digital reproduction (&lt;facsimile&gt;) of the original source: the URL of the picture is expressed by the attribute @url of the (&lt;graphic/&gt;) element. The text of the title page is then articulated into the main heading (THE WASTE LAND / By / T. S. Eliot) and an introductory quotation. The former is introduced by the &lt;head&gt; element, the latter is marked as &lt;quote&gt;.








&lt;body&gt;
The &lt;body&gt; element encloses the text of the poem: its stanzas and lines. The following schema shows the general structure of this part.
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;!--page n--&gt;
  &lt;pb/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;facsimile&gt;
      &lt;graphic/&gt;
    &lt;/facsimile&gt;
    &lt;lg type=“poemPage”&gt;
    &lt;/lg&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
The structure highlighted in red is reused for each page of the poem. Specifically, the first four elements (&lt;pb/&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;facsimile&gt;, &lt;graphic/&gt;) are devoted to pagination and coincide with the opening tags of the &lt;titlePage&gt;. However, the main element of this section is &lt;lg type=“poemPage”&gt;, i.e., the element containing the headings, the stanzas/lines, and the notes written by T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and Vivienne Eliot. At this level, the &lt;lg&gt; element always presents two attributes: @n (page number) and @type (in this case, the attribute always assumes the value poemPage). The &lt;lg type=“poemPage”&gt; element usually includes the following direct children:
-	&lt;lg&gt;: at this level, the line group elements identify the stanzas of the poem. Therefore, the opening tag must include the attributes @n (stanza number) and @type (in this case, the attribute always assumes the value stanza).  
-	&lt;head&gt;: the poem is made up of several sections, each of them having its own title. Moreover, some pages of the typescript present an opening numeration, which is also included inside the element &lt;head&gt;.
-	&lt;note&gt;: the most peculiar feature of the Waste Land Original Drafts is the remarkable number of annotations later written by the author, his colleague Ezra Pound, and his wife Vivienne Eliot. While introducing notes, it is crucial to pinpoint the major difference between &lt;note&gt; elements and some other types of intervention in the text, like &lt;add&gt; instances: we generally identify as &lt;add&gt; those additional notes produced within the body of the text (e.g.: overwritten corrections, inline annotations, external additions of text whose exact location in the poem is made explicit by graphic or written signals), whereas &lt;note&gt; elements refer to annotations located elsewhere in the document, outside the original body of the text. 
The set of possible children of the &lt;lg type=“poemPage”&gt; element also comprises some other tags, which generally enclose a large portion of text. Let’s consider the following example: an entire stanza is included within a circle. In this case, the element &lt;lg type=“stanza”&gt; is nested inside the &lt;hi&gt; tag. These are the other possible inner elements (some other tags will be examined in the final section Other transcription elements):
-	&lt;delSpan&gt;: it marks the beginning of a longer portion of text deleted, i.e., all the deletions which are longer than a single verse. This element is characterized by the following attributes: @hand  (the author of the deletion), @spanTo (a reference to the end point of the deletion span)
-	&lt;metamark&gt;: any kind of signal expressing how the document should be read. For instance, it can be used for a stanza/line/word whose new location inside the text is pointed by an arrow. This element is characterized by the following attributes: @hand (the author of the signal), @place (the place inside the text), @rend (the shape/aspect of the signal), and @target (the target of the signal)
&lt;lg type=“stanza”&gt;
This element is always nested inside a &lt;lg type=“poemPage”&gt; element. The main components of each stanza are lines, marked by the tag &lt;l&gt;. In order to facilitate access to the text, the lines have been numbered five by five through the attribute @n (line number). 
Other transcription elements:
This gentle introduction to the Waste Land Original Drafts XML/TEI encoding is based on some other transcription elements, whose position inside the XML structure might vary depending on the exact location (original typescript) and also with regard to how the editor decided to interpret them. For instance, the &lt;add&gt; element might be included inside a &lt;l&gt; element when the addition concerns the line itself. On the other side, it might happen that a whole new verse is added at the end of a given stanza: in this case, the &lt;add&gt; element is nested inside a &lt;lg&gt;. Moreover, an addition might occur inside a &lt;note&gt;. Here is a list of these transcription elements:
-	&lt;add&gt;: the addition of a portion of text. This element is characterized by the following attributes: @hand (the author of the addition), @place (the place inside the text, e.g.: margin-left, overwritten, etc.)
-	&lt;anchor&gt;: the anchor point element marks a specific point within a text. For instance, it might be required to identify the end of a &lt;delSpan&gt;.
-	&lt;del&gt;: the deletion of a portion of text. This element is characterized by the attribute @hand, expressing the author of the deletion.
-	&lt;hi&gt;: this element marks a portion of text that is graphically distinct from the surrounding text. It takes the following attributes: @hand (the author of the marker), @rend (the shape/aspect of the marker).
-	&lt;subst&gt;: this element marks a group of one or more deletions and one or additions.
